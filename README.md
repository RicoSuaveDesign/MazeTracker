# MazeTracker

Project for data structures that involved implementing a linked list and then implementing a stack to create a maze tracker that could solve square mazes.

Example mazes are in the examples folder.

 - S = start
 - F = free
 - B = blocked
 - E = end

 Tracker starts at start, can traverse free spaces, and solves for the end space. Blocked spaces cannot be traversed.
